		"abstract": "There is a disparity between the autopsy prevalence and the clinical incidence of in situ carcinoma of the breast without co-existing invasive carcinoma. The probability of developing in situ carcinoma is about 25%, while the cumulated risk of having the diagnosis established is less than 1%. In situ carcinoma in its pure form constitutes roughly 6% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers whereas in the most thorough mammographic screening series the incidence ranges from 8 to 16%. This excess in diagnosis comprises the ductal type in particular, primarily in its most aggressive forms, while the lobular type is no more common than in clinical series. Today in situ cancers occur chiefly as non-palpable lesions shown on mammography or as small changes accidentally discovered by the pathologist in a meticulous examination of an otherwise benign specimen. This survey also describes the traditional histopathological classification and presents in more detail a new classification based on histological growth patterns. The advantage of classifying in situ cancer according to its growth pattern is that it shows a good correlation with its clinical presentation. Moreover, the growth pattern can indicate the extent of excision. In addition, the method also seems to be applicable to prognosis. The treatment of in situ carcinoma has not been worked out scientifically, so treatment should be kept within the framework of prospective clinical trials. This is the only way to collect useful data about the biological behaviour of such lesions. In several countries large multicentre studies are being conducted to extend our knowledge about carcinoma in situ and to create a rational basis for treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 38]",

		"abstract": "The incidence and pattern of elastosis of the breast was studied in tissue specimens taken at autopsy from 140 women with clinically normal breasts, ranging in age from 19 through 101 years. Elastosis, presence of excess elastic fibers, while less common in younger women, may be found in nearly half of all women over age 50 years with no breast disease. Elastosis occurs in three sites: diffusely in the stroma, around vessels, and around ducts. In the first two sites, it bears little relationship to age, while periductal elastic tissue appears to accumulate with age, probably reflecting parity, until about age 50 years. Thereafter, it is found at a more or less constant incidence and degree. While it may be associated with breast cancer, periductal elastosis by itself is not a cause for concern. Marked perivascular elastosis is, however, uncommon at any age, and its presence should suggest a special search for carcinoma, if not already evident.",

The method used was a conventional but detailed and systematic examination, both macroscopically and histologically of all available breast tissue. Consequently autopsi material has been the natural basis of the studies. Three groups of women have been examined: 1. A consecutive series of 110 younger women, mean age 39 years, undergoing medicolegal autopsy at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Copenhagen, Denmark, from October 1983 to July 1984. 2. A consecutive series of 83 unselected, elderly women, mean age 67 years, undergoing autopsy at a large community hospital in Esbjerg, Jutland, Denmark, from November 1976 to May 1977. 3. A consecutive series of 84 women, mean age 74 years, dying with a known diagnosis of breast cancer and undergoing autopsy at two community hospitals in the Copenhagen area, (Glostrup and Frederiksberg), Denmark, from November 1982 to December 1984. The main results were: 1. In younger women clinically occult in situ breast cancer lesions occurred with surprisingly high frequency, 18%, a result which may influence the planning of future screening programs. 2. In elderly women, dying from a number of various reasons, invasive breast carcinomas were found with a frequency corresponding to the life-long risk of Danish women having this disease diagnosed clinically, 8%. Occult in situ carcinomas were found in 18%. 3. In women dying with a clinical diagnosis of breast cancer, the frequency of malignant histological changes in the opposite breast (metastases, invasive and in situ breast carcinomas) was unexpectedly high, 80%, a result which should be taken into consideration during clinical follow-up after treatment for breast cancer.
